# Bankruptcy-Prediction

-	Problem Statement: Bankruptcy prediction is considered important due to its relevance for creditors and investors in evaluating the likelihood that a firm might go bankrupt and take early actions to limit their economic losses. I have used SVM, Logistic, Random forest Classifier and among them got the best accuracy using Random forest classifier.
-	Steps: Data Cleaning ,EDA , Feature Engineering, Model creation and Evaluation.
-	Dataset:  6819 rows Ã— 96 columns

Accuracy by using different Algorithms


1. Accuracy for logistic regression is:  87.65 %

2. Accuracy for knn Classifier is:  96.36 %
